## CONVERSATION HISTORY
Previous conversation context (helps understand follow-up questions and references):
{conversation_history}

---

Analyze this user query and classify it into ONE of these categories:

**retrieve_corpus**: Query can be answered from academic papers in our database
- Examples: "What did Zhang et al. report about prompt templates?", "Which method achieved highest accuracy in the Spider dataset?", "Explain the methodology used in paper X"
- ALSO INCLUDES general topic questions that could be found in academic papers: "What are SQL challenges?", "What methods exist for text-to-SQL?", "How does neural machine translation work?"
- INCLUDES follow-up questions that refer to previous answers when the context is clear

**search_web**: Query requires current/external information not in papers
- When user explicitly requests web search: "Search online for...", "Look up on the web..."

**corpus_and_web_search**: Query explicitly asks to combine internal knowledge with web search results.
- Examples: "Compare the findings in your documents with what's on the web about text-to-sql", "What are text-to-SQL challenges based on your internal knowledge and your search on internet?"

**clarify**: Query is too vague or ambiguous to process AND lacks sufficient context
- Examples: "How many examples are enough?" (without specifying for what task), "What's the best method?" (without domain context), "How does it work?" (without specifying what "it" refers to)
- Missing critical context that makes the query unanswerable even with conversation history

**end**: Conversation ending or greeting
- Examples: "thanks", "goodbye", "that's all", "hello"

IMPORTANT: 
- General topic questions about research domains should be classified as "retrieve_corpus", not "clarify"
- Follow-up questions with clear context from conversation history should be classified normally, not as "clarify"
- Only use "clarify" for genuinely ambiguous queries that lack essential context even with conversation history

Current User Query: "{query}"

Respond with ONLY the category name (retrieve_corpus, search_web, corpus_and_web_search, clarify, or end) followed by a confidence score (0-1).

The ambiguous query is: "{query}"

Common types of ambiguity to address:
1. **Missing Context**: What domain, dataset, or specific area are they asking about?
2. **Vague Terms**: What do they mean by "best", "enough", "better", "it", etc.?
3. **Missing Scope**: Are they asking about a specific paper, method, time period, or comparison?
4. **Undefined Referents**: What does "this", "that", "it", or "they" refer to?

Your response should:
- Be friendly and helpful
- Ask 2-3 specific, targeted questions
- Explain why the additional information is needed
- Provide examples when helpful

Format your response as a natural conversation, not as a numbered list.

Example good clarification:
"I'd be happy to help you with that! To give you the most accurate answer, I need a bit more context. Are you asking about examples for training a specific type of model (like text-to-SQL, question answering, etc.)? And when you say 'good accuracy,' what accuracy threshold or benchmark are you targeting? Also, are you working with a particular dataset or domain?"

1. Acknowledges what you understand from their query
2. Identifies the specific ambiguities that need resolution
3. Offers 2-3 concrete, specific options when possible
4. Uses available context to guide clarification

**Clarification Strategies:**
- If papers are available: Reference specific papers they might be asking about
- If vague quantifiers: Ask for specific thresholds or ranges
- If unclear comparisons: Ask what they're comparing against
- If undefined referents: Ask what specific entity they're referring to

**Response Format:**
Provide a natural, conversational clarification response. If you can offer specific options, structure them clearly.

**Example Good Response:**
"I can help you with that! I see you're asking about accuracy requirements. Based on the papers in our knowledge base, I found discussions about accuracy in different contexts. Are you asking about:

1. **Few-shot learning accuracy** (Zhang et al. discusses 3-5 examples achieving 85%+ accuracy)
2. **Training dataset size** for fine-tuning (Smith et al. suggests 1000+ examples for stable training)
3. **Evaluation accuracy** benchmarks for a specific task

Also, what accuracy threshold are you targeting - research-grade (90%+) or production-ready (95%+)?"

- User Query: "{query}"
- Classified Intent: {intent}
- Tasks Already Completed: {tasks_completed}
- Retrieved Document Context Available: {has_document_context}
- Web Search Context Available: {has_web_context}

**Planning Rules:**
1. ONLY use the exact agent names from the list above
2. Plan the minimal set of agents needed to answer the query
3. Consider dependencies between agents (e.g., you typically need retrieval or search before synthesis)
4. You can add web_search as a fallback if document retrieval quality is low
5. Use clarification agent only for truly ambiguous queries
6. End with synthesis agent to generate the final response

**Response Format:**
PLAN: <comma-separated list of agent names in execution order>
REASONING: <brief explanation of why this plan was chosen>
CONFIDENCE: <0-1 score indicating confidence in this plan>

Example Response:
PLAN: corpus_retrieval,synthesis

2. ASSESS: Determine if the current approach is working or needs adjustment
3. PLAN: Design the next steps based on what you've learned
4. FOCUS: Identify what specific aspect needs attention

**Key ReAct Patterns:**
- If retrieval quality was low → try different search strategy or move to web search
- If information is incomplete → gather more specific context before synthesis
- If conflicting evidence found → investigate deeper or seek clarification
- If user query is complex → break into sub-questions and tackle systematically

**Response Format:**
REASONING: <analyze what the observations tell us and what we should do next>
FOCUS: <what specific aspect should we concentrate on now>
PLAN: <comma-separated list of agent names in execution order>
CONFIDENCE: <0-1 score indicating confidence in this plan>

Example Response:
REASONING: The corpus retrieval found some relevant information but with low confidence scores (0.3). The user is asking about methodologies comparison, so we need more comprehensive coverage. Let me try web search to supplement the corpus data.
FOCUS: comparative methodology analysis
